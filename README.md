# SimpleDownload
Simple Bulk Downloader for the RD Levels Site. Allows you to download all levels or all checked levels from the 
[custom levels site](https://auburnsummer.github.io/rdlevels/).

## Usage
1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/huantianad/SimpleDownload/releases/).
2. Run the file.
3. The program will prompt you to choose between all and checked levels. Type "all" or "checked" (or "a" and "c") to choose.
4. The program will create a new sub-folder ("downloader") and download all the levels there.
   (It might seem like the program is stuck on the last level, it's probably just a big file.)
5. Profit.

Note: if you have the preorder, you can import multiple levels at the same time.
If you do not have the preorder, you can use [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to unzip multiple rdzips at the same time.
